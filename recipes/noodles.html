            2 cup measuring cup or bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Add chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned on all 
            sides (Chicken will not be cooked through at this point).  
            Remove chicken from skillet and set aside. </li>
        <li>Add remaining neutral oil and sesame oil to skillet. Add garlic 
            and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute, stirring 
            constantly. Stir in crushed red pepper. Add pasta and stir to 
            coat in garlic mixture. Add reserved soy sauce mixture and stir 
            until everything is well incorporated, scraping any browned bits

            water as needed to keep mixture saucy until pasta is cooked. Stir in
