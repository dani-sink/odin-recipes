    <h3 class="subheadings">Tiny Oatmeal Cookies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li> 

        <li>1 cup light brown sugar</li>

        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>

        <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

        <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>

        <li>1 1/4 cups old fashioned oats</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="subheadings">Fluffy Cream Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li> 

        <li>4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature</li>

        <li>1 (13-ounce) jar marshmallow cream</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

        <li>Pinch or two fine sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="steps-heading">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) with oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Combine butter, brown sugar, and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if using a hand mixer). Cream on medium speed until light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Add egg and vanilla extract, and mix on medium speed to combine.</li>
        <li>Add flour, oats, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt and mix on low speed until batter is evenly combined. Scrape the base and side of the bowl, then mix again on low speed just to make sure it’s evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Drop scant teaspoon-sized balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, staggering the rows of cookies, and leaving at least 1 1/2 inches of space between each ball. Transfer to the preheated oven and bake until lightly golden around the outside edge, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove cookies from the oven and tap baking sheets on your work surface a few times to help flatten the cookies. Allow cookies to cool for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
        <li>Once cookies have cooled, turn half of the cookies onto a baking sheet so the bottoms of the cookies are facing up.</li>
        <li>Add butter to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whip attachment (or in a large bowl if using a hand mixer) and beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Scrape the base and sides of the bowl well, then add the cream cheese and whip on medium-high speed until fluffy, 3 minutes more. Scrape the base and sides of the bowl well.</li>
        <li>Add marshmallow cream, vanilla, and salt and mix on medium speed until well incorporated.</li>
        <li>Spoon, spread, or pipe filling onto the inverted cookies. I like to use a disposable pastry bag with a 1/4 inch opening cut from the tip, aiming for about 1 teaspoon of filling on each cookie.</li>
        <li>Place the other cookies on top of the filling, pressing down gently to adhere. Gently transfer cookies to an airtight container or parchment lined tray, and tightly wrap the tray. Refrigerate cookies for at least 4 hours (and preferably overnight) - this allows the cookies to soften and the filling to become more set.</li>
        <li>Store cookies in an airtight container until ready to serve, they’ll keep at room temperature or refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
    </ol>
